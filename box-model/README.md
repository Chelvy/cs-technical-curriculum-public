# Box Model


## Instructions
- Review the solution image below
- Download the code from the `Unsolved` directory and attempt to fix the CSS so that it reflects the layout in the image.

## Rules
- You can add or edit CSS, but you cannot remove any of the properties. I.e. margin and widths must remain, but you can add new things!
- the navbar should be at the very top and span the entire width of the page (no white gaps)
- the three boxes should have zero white gaps on the right or left hand sides
- Do not review the solution file until you have completed the assignment
