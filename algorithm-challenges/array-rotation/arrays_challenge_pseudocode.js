// THE CHALLENGE
/*
Left Rotation:
A left rotation on an array shifts each element of the array 1 unit to the left. 

In this challenge, given an array 'arr' and a number 'd', perform 'd' rotations on the array and return the updated array.
*/

/**** 
 * SAMPLE INPUT
arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
d = 2;

SAMPLE OUTPUT
[3,4,5,1,2]

function rotateLeft(arr, d) {
    // create a copy of the array and save it in a temporary variable
    // loop through the array as many times as we need to do rotations
    // remove the first item of the array, store it in a temporary variable
    // add that temporary variable back at the end of the array
    // once completed, return the the newly rotated array
