// THE CHALLENGE

/*
Given an array of integers, write a function that calculates the 
product of all integers other than the number at index.

For example, input:

  [7, 12, 8, 9]

your function would return:

  [ 864, 504, 756, 672]

by calculating:

  [12*8*9, 7*8*9, 7*12*9, 7*12*8]


The solution must execute in O(n^2) time. (HINT: you'll want a nested loop!)
Do not use division in your solution.

function calculateProduct(arr) {
  // we'll need an array to store our new products, so create an array to store these values
  var res = [];

  // start by looping through the input array given
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // set our product value to default at 1
    var product = 1;

    // for each item in the array, loop through the input again
    for (var j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
      // if the array indexes don't match, calculate the product by taking the initial product value of 1, and multiplying
      // it by the array index value, this will give the product of the remaining integers in the array
      if (j != i) {
        product *= arr[j];
      }
    }

    // push the product to the empty array that we initialized to store the product
    res.push(product);
  }

  return res;
}

console.log(calculateProduct([7, 12, 8, 9]));
