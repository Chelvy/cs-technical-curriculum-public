// THE CHALLENGE

/* 
The fibonacci sequence is perhaps one of the most famous algorithms,
and definitely one of the most tested during technical interviews.

Give a number N, return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence,
where the sequence is:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The sequence is relatively simple mathematics. Each value is the sum
of the previous two values or:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

function fibonacci(num) {
    // initialize variables, "a" as 1, "b" as 0 to check for numbers that don't have
    // previous values to add up 

    // initialize a temporary holder variable to store temp value

    // using a while loop to execute the required logic only if the number 
    // is greater than 0

    // set the temporary variable to "a", which starts at 1

    // redefine a to equal the total of a and b

    // set b to equal whatever is stored in the temporary variable

    // reduce num by 1 digit, this will then repeat until num is 0

    // if num is not greater than 0, return b immediately, or return b after
    // the while loop has executed

    // execute the function
