## ‚ö°Ô∏è Student Instructions
- Decide on whether you will use a **ping pong**, **strong** or **traditional** pairing technique.
- One person will type while the partner checks for bugs, supervises, offers guidance etc.
- We are providing you with the boilerplate HTML and Bootstrap code. For this challenge,
you need to write the JavaScript to enable the functionality of the to-do list application.
- Create a simple to-do list that meets the following user stories:

*User Stories (what your application should be able to do)*
- A user should be able to type in their to-do item and add it to the list.
- A user should be able to click the button or hit the return key to complete the form.
- A user should be able to mark items in the list as complete.
- A user should be able to delete items from the to-do list.
- The application should not add an empty item to the list.


*Rules*
- You may use jQuery for ease of scripting, but you may not use any other packages that will handle operations for you.
- You should not use any extensive JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular.
- Both you and your partner should contribute equally to the codebase.
- You should use local storage to persist items.
- You are not permitted to consult outside resources such as Google, StackOverflow etc. You may consult official jQuery documentation on syntax issues.
