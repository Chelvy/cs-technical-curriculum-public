# ðŸ’¥ Career Services: Technical Interviewing Curriculum Materials

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

In this repository, you will find access to technical interviewing materials, coding challenges, and other resources to help you better prepare for the technical interview.


## Contents
1. [Algorithm challenges](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cs-technical-curriculum-public/tree/master/algorithm-challenges)
2. [Application development challenges](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cs-technical-curriculum-public/tree/master/application-challenges)
3. [Workshop materials](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cs-technical-curriculum-public/tree/master/technical-workshops)
    - Slideshow
    - Lesson plan
    - Suggested coding challenge


## How to Use
You are welcome to use this distribution of materials in any way you like. A couple of suggestions, though:
- Work through each of the algorithm challenges, targeting the subject matter you feel weakest in
- Use the workshop materials to review slides and the accompanying challenges

Each algorithm challenge contains four files, they should be used in the following order:
1. Unsolved... use this has your working file
2. Pseudocode... use this to review your pseudocode
3. Solved... use this to review a simple or logical solution
4. Optimized... use this to review an optimized or more refined version of the solution

## What if I spot an issue?
If you notice an issue or have a correction/refinement to any of the materials, please create an issue in the repository. This will be the quickest way to get the attention of our development team to work on it. Alternatively, you can issue a pull request against the repository with your correction.
